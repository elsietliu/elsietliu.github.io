							<h2>The Problem</h2>
							<p>Food waste is a major problem that often results from spoilage 
								of food within our own homes. Sometimes, however, we simply do 
								not know what to make with the leftovers we have. Our goal was 
								to build a recipe recommendation where a user would input their 
								ingredients and preferences they have, and the system would 
								output a list of potential recipes that they could make with 
								food that they already have.
							</p>
							<h2>The Solution</h2>
							<p>
								Pantry Pal is an application that provides users with recipes 
								based on their unique needs. The user can input both required 
								and optional ingredients for the recipes to contain, as well as 
								the category (main dish, dessert, etc.) and the time they have 
								to cook. The user can also input allergies or food intolerances 
								and receive only recipes that meet these standards. From these 
								inputs, the app will generate a list of 20 suggested recipes 
								for the user based on how well they match the inputs and how 
								well the recipes have been rated. This app is intended for 
								people who cook but may be out of ideas, short on time, or have 
								food allergies.
							</p>
							<h2>What's Already Out There?</h2>
							<p>Our approach is relatively similar to existing systems; 
								however, we intend to include additional user inputs to produce 
								results that are more specific to the user's needs. In the 
								existing systems, the user input is primarily a list of 
								ingredients in the form of either a checklist or text. Once the 
								recipes have been outputted, most of them have additional 
								filters that the user can use to find results that are even more 
								specific to their expectations. For instance, many of them have 
								filters for necessary ingredients, dietary restrictions, and 
								meal type. Additionally, the existing systems rank the recipes 
								based on whether the user has all the ingredients to make the 
								recipe and the number of ingredients that they have that match 
								with the recipe. Our system will take these factors into 
								consideration while also taking into account the reviews and 
								ratings into the rankings.
							</p>
							<h2>Interface Layout</h2>
							<p>
								I aimed to create a simple and intuitive interface that would 
								provide users with an easy way to discover new recipes.<br>
								I chose to use a two-part form that would walk the user through 
								each of the steps. The first part includes a text bar that 
								allows the user to input the ingredients they have. The second 
								section includes the option to choose mandatory ingredients that 
								must be included in the dish as well as any dietary restrictions, 
								the category of food (main dish, appetizer, etc.), and the time 
								it takes to make the dish. <br>
								Each part of the form also includes a reset button that allows 
								the user to easily clear any section of the form.
							</p>
							<h2>Algorithm</h2>
							<p>
								Given a list of ingredients from the user, we query a database 
								of foods from Food.com. We use an inverted index representation 
								for the database that maps the ingredients to a list of dishes 
								that use that ingredient. The algorithm then finds all the 
								dishes that contain the ingredients inputted by the user. Then, 
								the dishes that contain any potential allergens are filtered 
								out, as well as any dishes that don't correspond with the 
								category and time filters inputted by the user. Finally, the 
								dishes are outputted and ranked using Jaccard, so that dishes 
								with more ingredients that are not inputted by the user are 
								ranked lower. Any ties between the Jaccard scores are broken by
								the rating of each recipe.

							</p>
							<h2>Produced Output</h2>
							<p>
								The output is a list of up to 20 dishes that are based on the 
								user's input. Each output contains a link to the recipe as well 
								as a list of the ingredients required to make it.
