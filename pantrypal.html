							<h2>The Problem</h2>
							<p>Food waste is a major problem that often results from spoilage 
								of food within our own homes. Sometimes, however, we simply do 
								not know what to make with the leftovers we have. Our goal was 
								to build a recipe recommendation where a user would input their 
								ingredients and preferences they have, and the system would 
								output a list of potential recipes that they could make with 
								food that they already have.
							</p>
							<h2>The Solution</h2>
							<p>
								Pantry Pal is an application that provides users with recipes 
								based on their unique needs. The user can input both required 
								and optional ingredients for the recipes to contain, as well as 
								the category (main dish, dessert, etc.) and the time they have 
								to cook. The user can also input allergies or food intolerances 
								and receive only recipes that meet these standards. From these 
								inputs, the app will generate a list of 20 suggested recipes 
								for the user based on how well they match the inputs and how 
								well the recipes have been rated. This app is intended for 
								people who cook but may be out of ideas, short on time, or have 
								food allergies.
							</p>
							<h2>What's Already Out There?</h2>
							<p>Our approach is relatively similar to existing systems; 
								however, we intend to include additional user inputs to produce 
								results that are more specific to the user's needs. In the 
								existing systems, the user input is primarily a list of 
								ingredients in the form of either a checklist or text. Once the 
								recipes have been outputted, most of them have additional 
								filters that the user can use to find results that are even more 
								specific to their expectations. For instance, many of them have 
								filters for necessary ingredients, dietary restrictions, and 
								meal type. Additionally, the existing systems rank the recipes 
								based on whether the user has all the ingredients to make the 
								recipe and the number of ingredients that they have that match 
								with the recipe. Our system will take these factors into 
								consideration while also taking into account the reviews and 
								ratings into the rankings.
							</p>
							<h2>Interface Layout</h2>
							<p>
								I aimed to create a simple and intuitive interface that would 
								provide users with an easy way to discover new recipes.<br>
								I chose to use a two-part form that would walk the user through 
								each of the steps. On top of the forms, there is a visual cue
								that indicates which step you are at in the process. Each part 
								of the form also includes a reset button that allows the user 
								to easily clear any section of the form.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:center">
								<img src="images/pantrypal/visual_cue.gif" width="500" alt="demonstration of visual cue as user switches between forms">
							</p>
							<p>
								The first part includes a text bar that 
								allows the user to input the ingredients they have. Th user is 
								able to input add ingredients using the 'Add' button as well as
								pressing the enter key.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:center">
								<img src="images/pantrypal/enter_ingredients.gif" width="500" alt="adding chicken, celery, and carrot as ingredients">
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition to adding ingredients, the user can also delete the 
								ingredients that they've previously entered by clicking on the 
								'x' on each ingredient element.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:center">
								<img src="images/pantrypal/delete_ingredients.gif" width="500" alt="deleting chicken, celery, and carrot from list of ingredients that were previously entered">
							</p>
							<p>
								The second section includes the option to choose mandatory 
								ingredients that must be included in the dish as well as any 
								dietary restrictions, the category of food (main dish, 
								appetizer, etc.), and the time it takes to make the dish.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:center">
								<img src="images/pantrypal/optional_ings.gif" width="500" alt="demonstration of choosing mandatory ingredients">
							</p>
							<p>
								I ensured that the clickable elements are cohesive to make it 
								clear to the user that what they can alter. When user testing, 
								we recieved feedback that the ability to choose which ingredients 
								are required in the recipe was missed in an earlier prototype of
								the site. As a result, I decided to make the design more uniform.
							</p>

							<h2>Algorithm</h2>
							<p>
								Given a list of ingredients from the user, we query a database 
								of foods from Food.com. 
							<h3>Basic Text Processing</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>We used regex to extract and clean the ingredient list from the SQL file</li>
								<li>We used stemming on the ingredients in the database and input from the users so that plural ingredients were mapped to the same name (ex: egg and eggs)</li>
								<li>We made sure to deduplicate user input so that certain ingredients were not given more weight when we rated them</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Inverted Index</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Since we had a lot of recipes in our dataset, we created an inverted index where the key is the ingredient and the value is a list of recipes that contain the ingredient</li>
								<li>This allowed for our information retrieval to be much quicker than looking through each recipe one at a time</li>
								<li>We also used an inverted index for the allergies in which each allergy was mapped to a list of dishes that conflict with the allergy</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Boolean Search</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>We used boolean search to find recipes that contain the required ingredients inputted by the user (ex: egg AND flour AND water)</li>
								<li>We used boolean search to remove any recipes that contain certain allergens (ex: lettuce AND tomato NOT meat)</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Jaccard Similarity</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>As one component to evaluate the ranking of the recipe based on the query, we used Jaccard similarity. We calculate the similarity between the recipe ingredient list and the list of ingredients that the user inputted</li>
								<li>This allows us to prioritize recipes that have a closer ingredient similarity to the query</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Word-Document Matrix</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>To implement our LDA model, we used the built-in method in gensim to convert the reviews into bag-of-words format</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<h2>Input/Output Examples</h2>
							<p>
								The output is a list of up to 20 dishes that are based on the 
								user's input. For situations in which the user's inputs, the 
								system will output a list that displays the recipe name, link, 
								rating based on user reviews, and ingredient list.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:center">
								<img src="images/pantrypal/results.gif" width="500" alt="input/output example with proper inputs produces list of recipes">
							</p>
							<p>
								In the example above, all the ingredients and preferences inputted 
								by the user were proper. As a result, the system was able to 
								find a few recipes that fit the criteria set by the user.
							</p>
							<p>
								In contrast, if there are improper preferences entered by the user, 
								or there are no recipes within the database that fit the user's 
								requests, then an error message will be produced instead of a list 
								of recipes.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:center">
								<img src="images/pantrypal/bad_input.gif" width="500" alt="input/output example with conflicting inputs produces 'no recipe found' error message">
							</p>
							<p>
								In this example, the user inputted 'egg' as the mandatory ingredient 
								and set the dietary restriction as 'egg-free'. Because there are 
								conflicting inputs, there does not exist a recipe in which both 
								are true. Therefore, the system produces a 'no recipe found' 
								error message to indicate that the system compiled but there 
								are simply no recipes that meet the requirements.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:center">
								<img src="images/pantrypal/improper_ings.gif" width="500" alt="input/output example with no ingredients inputted produces 'no proper ingredient entered' error message">
							</p>
							<p>
								Likewise, if there are improper ingredients inputted, or missing 
								inputs, a similar message will be outputted by the system. In this 
								final example, the user did not input anything. Because the system 
								depends on ingredients to filter out possible recipes, it is 
								unable to process anything. As a result, instead of a list of recipes, 
								there is a 'no proper ingredient entered' error message.
